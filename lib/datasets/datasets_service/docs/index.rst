Welcome to CanDIG Datasets Service's documentation!
===================================================


The Datasets service is one of the services that make up the CanDIG v2 platform.
It acts as lookup service for querying datasets within CanDIG through possible 
parameters such as ID, tags, versions and ontologies (currently only `DUO`__ is supported).
