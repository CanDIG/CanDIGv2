# Implementation Notes
#
# Multiple predecessors:
#   There is special-case handling for jobs with multiple predecessors as a
#   performance optimization. This minimize number of expensive loads of
#   JobDescriptions from jobStores.  However, this special case could be unnecessary.
#   The JobDescription is loaded to update predecessorsFinished, in
#   _checkSuccessorReadyToRunMultiplePredecessors, however it doesn't appear to
#   write the JobDescription back the jobStore.  Thus predecessorsFinished may really
#   be leader state and could moved out of the JobDescription.  This would make this
#   special-cases handling unnecessary and simplify the leader.
#   Issue #2136
