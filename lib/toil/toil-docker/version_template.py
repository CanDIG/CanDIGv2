"""This script is a template for src/toil/version.py. Running it without arguments echoes all
globals, i.e. module attributes. Constant assignments will be echoed verbatim while callables
will be invoked and their result echoed as an assignment using the function name as the left-hand
side and the return value of the function as right-hand side. To prevent a module attribute from
being echoed, start or end the attribute name with an underscore. To print the value of a single
symbol, pass the name of that attribute to the script as a command line argument. You can also
import the expand_ function and invoke it directly with either no or exactly one argument."""

# Note to maintainers:
#
#  - don't import at module level unless you want the imported value to be
#    included in the output
#  - only import from the Python standard run-time library (you can't have any
#    dependencies)
#  - don't import even standard modules at global scope without renaming them
#    to have leading/trailing underscores
