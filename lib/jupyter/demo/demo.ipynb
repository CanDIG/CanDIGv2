    "## A brief primer on variant calling\n",
    "\n",
    "The DNA sequences of two individuals in a population will be different because of crossover between parents' genes and because of random mutations. For a wide variety of applications, it has become important to know an individual's genetic composition (or genotype). But do we need to store the whole sequence?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that, instead of storing the whole sequence, we can simply store the difference between an individual's DNA sequence and a reference individual, as illustrated in this image from the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/human-genetic-variation-i-introduction/variant-identification-and-analysis/what-variant):\n",

    "\n",
    "In the image, the gray lines are \"reads\" from the sequencing instrument. The red letters indicate the areas where the reads differ from the reference DNA sequence (depicted in color). These differences are called variants, and the variants are stored in a tab-delimited text file called a Variant Caller Format (VCF) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying variants requires a sophisticated algorithm such as GATK or DeepVariant. For one thing, the reads from the instrument have to be aligned to the reference DNA sequence. The reads may not exactly match any part of the reference because ... variants. Even though the image above shows differences in just one letter (or single nucleotide polymorphism), variants can be more complex -- entire subsequences might be deleted, inserted, inverted, duplicated, or duplicated repeatedly:\n",

    "\n",
    "Variants are significant, not just because they allow more efficient storage, but because genetic differences between individuals can lead to differences in an individual's phenotype (such as their height or risk of developing a disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variant calling is the process of going from sequences (typically stored in a BAMS files) to identifying variants between an individual and a reference genome (typically stored in a VCF file). Once we have the variants, then it is possible to do analysis on the variants to look for specific genetic markers.\n",
